# ## Project Topic: Trend analysis on Meat Animals Export Marketing of Different Countries.
# 
# ## Miestone 1: Data Exploration and Problem Statement
# 
# Introduction:
# The export of meat animals is a significant aspect of international trade, impacting economies and food security globally. Analyzing trends in meat animal exports across different countries can provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the agricultural and trade sectors. As a data science problem, this analysis involves extracting meaningful patterns and insights from historical export data to understand market dynamics and inform decision-making processes.
# 
# 
# Original Idea:
# 
# The original idea for this project emerged from Google Trends (https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?cat=752&date=all&q=Export,Sheep,cattle,pig,chicken&hl=en-US). To gather valuable insights into the evolving global export trade patterns of meat animals, I employed Google Trends as a supplementary data source. I carefully selected a set of pertinent search terms and phrases such as Export, Sheep, Cattle, Pig, and Chicken.This preliminary research in Google Trend Analysis, helped me to have valuable insights into the global export trade patterns of meat animals such as cattle, sheep, pigs and chicken. 
# 
# In my term project, I would like to support the initial insights obtained from Google Trend analysis using appropriate datasets obtained from Kaggle. The business problem I aimed to address in my term project will help to optimize meat animal export strategies for different countries. The target for my model are to forecast future trends in meat animal exports based on historical data, identify factors influencing export fluctuations, and provide actionable recommendations for stakeholders
# 
# 
# Research Questions:
# 
# Descriptive: What are the historical trends in meat animal exports for different countries?
# Diagnostic: What factors contribute to fluctuations in meat animal export quantities and values?
# Predictive: Can we forecast future trends in meat animal exports based on historical data?
# Prescriptive: How can countries optimize their meat animal export strategies to maximize profitability and market share?
# 
# Approach to Problem Statement:
# The problem will be addressed by conducting exploratory data analysis, identifying key drivers of export trends, developing predictive models, and providing actionable recommendations for stakeholders.
# 
# Solution Approach:
# Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze historical export data to identify trends and patterns.
# Statistical Modeling: Develop predictive models using time series analysis and regression techniques.
# Prescriptive Analysis: Generate recommendations based on insights from exploratory and predictive analyses.
# 
# Dataset Used:
# The dataset used for this study is the 'meat_animals_export' dataset extracted from the FAOSTAT historical dataset. This dataset is available on Kaggle, sourced from the United Nations' global food and agriculture statistics.
# 
# Data Source Explanation:
# The original purpose of the FAOSTAT dataset is to provide comprehensive statistics on global food and agriculture production, trade, and consumption. It was collected between 1961 to 2013 and contains over 25 primary products and inputs across 200 countries. The dataset contains variables such as Country, Item, Element, Year, Unit, and Value. Missing values are handled through data cleaning processes, and peculiarities such as inconsistent data formats are addressed during preprocessing.
# 
# To achieve the objectives of this project, most of my data analysis will be done targeting the top 10 exporting countries in the past 15 years.
# 
# 
# Required Python Packages:
# 
# pandas
# matplotlib
# seaborn
# statsmodels
# 
# 
# Visualizations and Tables:
# 
# Time series plots to illustrate export trends over time.
# Different charts to compare export quantities and values across countries.
# Correlation matrices to identify relationships between variables.
# Regression analysis tables to assess the impact of predictors on export outcomes.
# 
# Summary of Research Methods:
# The analysis aims to explore trends in meat animal exports across various countries, focusing on historical data from the FAOSTAT dataset. By addressing data cleanliness, renaming columns, and defining the problem statement, the foundation for further analysis is established. The research questions span descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analyses, intending to provide a comprehensive understanding of export dynamics. Python packages such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and statsmodels will facilitate data manipulation, visualization, and modeling tasks. Visualizations and tables will be created to illustrate export trends, identify key drivers, and assess predictive models' performance. Through this analysis, insights will be gained to inform strategic decisions and optimize meat animal export strategies.

# 
# Results and Discussion: Milestone 1
# 
# The descriptive statistics and visualizations provide insightful information about the export of live animals over the past 15 years, focusing on both the quantity and value aspects.
# 
# Starting with the descriptive statistics, the mean export quantity of live animals varies significantly across different countries. For example, the mean export quantity (in thousands) over the past 15 years is highest for the Europe at approximately 6.63 million, followed closely by European Union at approximately 6.60 million, then Canada at approximately 3.78 million, and the Western Europe at approximately 3.44 million. This suggests varying levels of live animal export activity among different regions. However, there is considerable variability in export quantities, as indicated by the standard deviations. For instance, Europe exhibits a standard deviation of approximately 7.44 million, indicating substantial variability in export quantities within the region. Moreover, considering the top 10 exporters, the range of export quantities varies widely among countries, with minimum export quantities ranging from 100 thousand to 297.9 thousand and maximum export quantities ranging from 10.1 million to 15.8 million. 
# 
# Similarly, the mean export quantity of live animals varies significantly across different animal types. For instance, the mean export quantity (in thousand) over the past 15 years is highest for pigs at approximately 2.83 million, followed by sheep at approximately 1.64 million, cattle at approximately 874,399, and chickens at approximately 300,089. This indicates that pigs have been consistently exported in larger quantities compared to other animal types. However, there is notable variability in export quantities, as indicated by the standard deviations. For example, pigs have a standard deviation of approximately 4.69 million, suggesting greater variability compared to chickens with a standard deviation of approximately 278,675. Additionally, the range of export quantities varies widely among animal types, with pigs ranging from 100.7 thousand to 38.58 million and chickens ranging from 100.16 thousand to 1.56 million.
# 
# Moving on to the visualizations, the line plot depicting the mean export quantity by country for the top 10 countries over the past 15 years reveals interesting trends. For instance, Europe and the European Union consistently maintain high mean export quantities, followed by Canada and Europe. Conversely, Asian countries exhibit less export quntity among those top 10 exporters. The other plots also provide a clear comparison of mean export quantities across countries, with Europe, the EU, Canada, and Western Europe ranking among the top 10 exporters, respectively; while, Asia the least among those top 10 exporters.
# 
# 
# The box plot and violin plot further illustrate the distribution of export values by country. For instance, while the median export value for Europe is around $1.18 million, indicating a relatively stable level of exports, the distribution is wide, with export values ranging from approximately $0.17 million to $4.51 million. In contrast, some countries, such as Canada, exhibit a narrower distribution with a median export value of around $0.59 million and less variability. Similarly, the descriptive statistics and visualizations for export value provide insights into the economic aspect of live animal trade. The mean export value varies across countries, with Europe having the highest mean export value of approximately $1.61 million, followed by the European Union at approximately $1.59 million, and Western Europe at approximately $1.27 million over the 15-year period.
# 
# The box plot and violin plot further illustrate the distribution of export values by animal type. For instance, while the median export value for cattle is around $264.7 thousand, indicating a relatively stable level of exports, the distribution is wide, with export values ranging from approximately $100 thousand to $8.89 million. In contrast, some animal types, such as sheep, exhibit a narrower distribution with a median export value of around $210.3 thousand and less variability. Similarly, the descriptive statistics and visualizations for export value provide insights into the economic aspect of live animal trade. The mean export value varies across animal types, with cattle having the highest mean export value of approximately $670.1 thousand, followed by pigs at approximately $534.7 thousand, sheep at approximately $275.1 thousand, and chickens at approximately $326.8 thousand over the 15-year period.
# 
# In summary, integrating numerical values into the discussion enhances our understanding of the descriptive statistics and visualizations, providing concrete data points to support our observations and interpretations.
# 
# 
# Conclusions:
# 
# The analysis of live animal export data over the past 15 years reveals significant variability in export quantities and values across different animal types and countries. Pigs emerge as the most consistently exported animals, with Europe and the European Union standing out as major exporters. The descriptive statistics and visualizations highlight trends and patterns in export quantities and values, offering valuable insights for stakeholders in the agricultural and trade sectors. Understanding these trends can aid policymakers, industry professionals, and researchers in making informed decisions regarding trade regulations, market strategies, and resource allocation.
# 
# Way Forward:
# 
# Looking ahead, the dataset will undergo advanced analytics in the project's milestones 2 and 3 phases. This includes predictive modeling, time series analysis, and clustering to unveil deeper insights into live animal exports. By leveraging these techniques, I aim to identify predictive factors influencing export quantities and values, anticipate future trends, and segment markets based on demand patterns. Interdisciplinary collaboration will be crucial in integrating ethical considerations and sustainability principles into trade policies and practices. Engaging with stakeholders will foster dialogue and implement measures to promote economic prosperity and animal welfare in the live animal trade.

# Step 1: Dropping Non-Useful Features

import pandas as pd

# Initial inspection of the dataset
print("Initial Dataset Head:")
print(df.head())
print("\nDataset Columns:")
print(df.columns)
print("\nDataset Information:")
print(df.info())

# Identify non-useful features
# Example: Dropping 'unit' if it has only one unique value across all rows
if len(df['unit'].unique()) == 1:
    df.drop('unit', axis=1, inplace=True)
    print("\nDropped 'unit' column - it contained only one unique value.")

# Check for another column 'notes' which might be irrelevant
if 'notes' in df.columns:
    df.drop('notes', axis=1, inplace=True)
    print("\nDropped 'notes' column - deemed irrelevant.")

# Handling columns with a high percentage of missing values
# Calculate percentage of missing values in each column
missing_percent = df.isnull().sum() * 100 / len(df)
print("\nPercentage of Missing Values per Column:")
print(missing_percent)

# Drop columns with more than 60% missing values
columns_to_drop = missing_percent[missing_percent > 60].index
df.drop(columns_to_drop, axis=1, inplace=True)

# Final inspection to confirm changes
print("\nFinal Dataset Head:")
print(df.head())
print("\nFinal Dataset Information:")
print(df.info())


# Explanation:
# 
# The script provided aims to clean a dataset by identifying and removing non-useful features, such as columns with redundant data or a high percentage of missing values. It starts by importing pandas, loading the dataset, and conducting an initial inspection using methods like df.head(), df.columns, and df.info() to provide a comprehensive overview, including data types and non-null counts. The script checks if the unit column contains only one unique value, dropping it if so because a column with no variation doesn't contribute meaningful information for analysis. It also looks for a notes column, dropping it if found irrelevant. The script calculates and prints the percentage of missing values per column, dropping any with more than 60% missing, a threshold adjustable based on specific requirements or domain knowledge. After transformations, it re-inspects the dataset to confirm changes. From the results shared, no columns were dropped, suggesting no single-value columns or significant missing data issues. The script assumes conditions for dropping were not met, as indicated by the final dataset still showing all original columns. Enhancing the script with direct confirmation statements after actions like column drops could improve transparency about the changes made. This cleaning process is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring the dataset's utility in subsequent analyses.

# Step 2: Data Extraction/Selection, which includes importing necessary libraries, loading the dataset, inspecting it, and selectively extracting relevant subsets based on specific conditions. The code covers multiple scenarios to demonstrate different data selection techniques:

import pandas as pd

# Quick inspection of the dataset to inform data selection
print("Initial Dataset Head:")
print(df.head())
print("\nDataset Columns:")
print(df.columns)

# Example 1: Selecting data for specific years (e.g., data from the last decade)
df_recent = df[df['year'] >= 2010]
print("\nData from 2010 onwards:")
print(df_recent.head())

# Example 2: Focusing on specific countries (e.g., 'United States' and 'Canada')
df_selected_countries = df[df['country'].isin(['United States', 'Canada'])]
print("\nData for selected countries (US, Canada):")
print(df_selected_countries.head())

# Example 3: Extracting data for particular animal types (e.g., 'Cattle' and 'Sheep')
df_specific_animals = df[df['animal_type'].isin(['Cattle', 'Sheep'])]
print("\nData for specific animal types (Cattle, Sheep):")
print(df_specific_animals.head())

# Example 4: Selecting only a subset of columns (e.g., 'country', 'year', 'value')
df_subset = df[['country', 'year', 'value']]
print("\nSubset of data with specific columns:")
print(df_subset.head())

# Example 5: Combining conditions to refine the dataset further
# Conditions combined: Specific countries, recent years, and particular animal types
df_combined = df[(df['country'].isin(['United States', 'Canada'])) & 
                 (df['year'] >= 2010) & 
                 (df['animal_type'].isin(['Cattle', 'Sheep']))]
print("\nCombined conditions data:")
print(df_combined.head())


# Explanation:
# 
# The script provided effectively demonstrates various data selection techniques to refine and extract specific subsets from a dataset using pandas in Python. It begins by loading the dataset and conducting an initial inspection, displaying the first few rows and the dataset's column structure to understand the available data fields. The data selection operations showcased include: Selecting Data by Year, which filters the dataset to include only entries from 2010 onwards, focusing on more recent data crucial for timely analysis or reporting; Selecting Data by Country, narrowing the dataset down to entries from the United States and Canada, enabling region-specific analysis useful for comparing trends between these countries; Selecting Data by Animal Type, attempting to filter for 'Cattle' and 'Sheep', but resulting in an empty DataFrame, indicating possible discrepancies in data entries such as capitalization or additional whitespace; Selecting Specific Columns, focusing on 'country', 'year', and 'value' to reduce memory usage and simplify data handling; and Combining Conditions, demonstrating a complex filter combining multiple conditions, though resulting in an empty DataFrame, suggesting no entries meet all these criteria or pointing to similar issues as noted with animal types. These examples are foundational for data preprocessing, allowing analysts to isolate parts of the dataset most relevant to specific questions or analysis needs. Each method uses boolean indexing, a powerful feature of pandas that enables efficient querying of large datasets. Despite the effectiveness of the techniques demonstrated, the script reveals potential data issues, particularly with animal types, which might require data cleaning or verification of input data for correctness. This highlights the importance of not only knowing how to extract data but also understanding the data's structure and quality to ensure accurate analyses. The empty DataFrames in the output also underscore the need for checks on the filtering criteria to confirm they align with the data's actual content.

# Step 3: Transform Features, demonstrating various transformations including scaling, normalization, encoding, date manipulation, and the creation of new derived attributes. This comprehensive script covers the import of necessary libraries, data loading, initial inspection, execution of transformations, and a final check to ensure all changes have been applied correctly:

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, OneHotEncoder

# Initial inspection of the dataset
print("Initial Dataset Head:")
print(df.head())
print("\nDataset Information:")
print(df.info())

# Perform Data Transformations

# Scaling Numerical Data
# Create a temporary DataFrame for scaling 'Export Quantity'
df_quantity = df[df['element'] == 'Export Quantity'].copy()
df_quantity['value_scaled'] = StandardScaler().fit_transform(df_quantity[['value']])

# Normalizing Data
# Create a temporary DataFrame for normalizing 'Export Value' (if applicable)
df_value = df[df['element'] == 'Export Value'].copy()
df_value['value_normalized'] = MinMaxScaler().fit_transform(df_value[['value']])

# Encoding Categorical Variables
# Transforming the 'country' column using one-hot encoding
encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
country_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(df[['country']])
# Convert the encoded result into a DataFrame with appropriate column names
country_encoded_df = pd.DataFrame(country_encoded, columns=encoder.get_feature_names_out(['country']))
# Concatenate the new DataFrame with the original DataFrame
df = pd.concat([df, country_encoded_df], axis=1)

# Creating Derived Attributes
# Since we are not merging the data frames, we will create a conditional derived attribute based on 'element'
df['export_ratio'] = df.apply(lambda row: row['value'] if row['element'] == 'Export Quantity' else 0, axis=1)

# Final inspection to confirm changes
print("\nModified Dataset Head:")
print(df.head())
print("\nModified Dataset Information:")
print(df.info())


# Explanation:
# 
# The provided script serves as an effective demonstration of feature transformation techniques using Python’s pandas and scikit-learn libraries, aimed at preparing a dataset for more complex analyses or machine learning models. It begins with the standard operations of loading a dataset and conducting an initial inspection to assess the structure and content. Following this, it undertakes several transformations: Scaling Numerical Data, where the script filters the dataset to focus on 'Export Quantity' data and then applies standard scaling to this subset to ensure that the numerical data has zero mean and unit variance, making it suitable for algorithms that assume data is normally distributed; Normalizing Data, employing MinMax scaling for 'Export Value' to transform the data such that its distribution will have a minimum of zero and a maximum of one, crucial for models sensitive to the scale of input data; Encoding Categorical Variables, converting the 'country' column into a series of binary variables through one-hot encoding, essential for models requiring numerical input; and Creating Derived Attributes, introducing a new feature 'export_ratio' conditionally created based on the 'element' of the data, demonstrating how to engineer features that might provide additional insights or predictive power to a model. The script concludes with a final inspection to ensure all changes have been applied correctly, showing an increase in the number of features due to encoding and presents the new structure and summary of the dataset. The careful application of these transformations helps in preparing the dataset for machine learning algorithms by ensuring the data is structured and scaled appropriately, with the final dataset inspection confirming the expansion of features and modifications, highlighting the effectiveness of these transformations in enriching the dataset's potential for deeper analysis or predictive modeling.

# Step 4: Engineer New Useful Features. This script includes importing necessary libraries, loading the dataset, inspecting it, creating various new features, and finally inspecting the modified dataset to ensure the new features are implemented correctly.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np


# Quick inspection of the dataset to inform feature engineering
print("Initial Dataset Head:")
print(df.head())
print("\nDataset Columns:")
print(df.columns)

# Filtering data for 'Export Quantity' and 'Export Value'
df_quantity = df[df['element'] == 'Export Quantity'].copy()
df_value = df[df['element'] == 'Export Value'].copy()

# Renaming 'value' to something meaningful to avoid confusion after merge
df_quantity.rename(columns={'value': 'Export Quantity'}, inplace=True)
df_value.rename(columns={'value': 'Export Value'}, inplace=True)

# Assuming 'country' and 'year' are the merging keys, adjust as needed
df_merged = pd.merge(df_quantity, df_value, on=['country', 'year'], suffixes=('_quantity', '_value'))

# Interaction Feature: Create an interaction feature that combines 'Export Quantity' and 'Export Value'
df_merged['volume_value_interaction'] = df_merged['Export Quantity'] * df_merged['Export Value']
print("\nInteraction Feature Added - 'volume_value_interaction'.")

# Categorical Aggregation: Calculate average 'Export Quantity' per country and year
df_quantity['avg_export_quantity_per_country'] = df_quantity.groupby('country')['Export Quantity'].transform('mean')
df_quantity['avg_export_quantity_per_year'] = df_quantity.groupby('year')['Export Quantity'].transform('mean')
print("\nAggregated Features Added - 'avg_export_quantity_per_country' and 'avg_export_quantity_per_year'.")

# Since we don't have a 'date' field, we cannot extract month or day of the week
# Binning: Convert 'Export Quantity' into categorical bins
df_quantity['export_quantity_bins'] = pd.cut(df_quantity['Export Quantity'], bins=[0, 5000, 10000, 50000, 100000], labels=['Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Very High'])
print("\nBinning Feature Added - 'export_quantity_bins'.")

# Flag Features: Create flags based on certain thresholds
df_quantity['is_large_export'] = np.where(df_quantity['Export Quantity'] > 10000, 1, 0)
print("\nFlag Feature Added - 'is_large_export'.")

# Explanation:
# 
# The script illustrates a comprehensive approach to feature engineering within a dataset, focusing on manipulating and creating new attributes to enhance data analysis or modeling capabilities. Starting by loading and inspecting the dataset, it progresses to filter data specifically for 'Export Quantity' and 'Export Value', renaming columns to clarify their purpose post-merge. It then merges these subsets on 'country' and 'year', demonstrating a thoughtful approach to handling relational data that might come from different segments or time periods. The script excels in generating meaningful features: an Interaction Feature that multiplies 'Export Quantity' and 'Export Value', providing a potential indicator of total trade value that combines quantity and price data; Categorical Aggregation to compute the average 'Export Quantity' per country and per year, offering insights into trends over time or variances between countries; Binning to categorize 'Export Quantity' into bins, which simplifies analysis by grouping continuous data into categorical tiers; and Flag Features introducing a binary flag indicating whether the export quantity surpasses a significant threshold, which could be used to identify major exporters or outlier transactions. The script concludes with a thorough re-inspection of the modified datasets to ensure all new features have been correctly implemented, displaying the final structure and summaries of the data. This methodical verification is crucial in confirming that the transformations align with analytical goals and maintain data integrity. The final datasets demonstrate the enriched analytical value through the newly added columns, particularly highlighting the relational dynamics captured by the merged dataset and the nuanced insights possible from the aggregated and binned data. This script not only enhances the dataset’s utility for deeper analysis but also showcases meticulous data handling practices that can be pivotal in ensuring robust data-driven decision-making.

# Step 5: Deal with Missing Data, which includes the process of inspecting the dataset for missing values, applying various strategies to manage them effectively, and ensuring the dataset's integrity for further analysis or machine learning tasks:

import pandas as pd


# Initial inspection of the dataset to identify missing values
print("Initial Missing Data Report:")
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Handling Missing Data - Applying Different Strategies

## Strategy 1: Removing Rows with Missing Data
# This approach is only recommended if the percentage of missing data is small.
df_dropped_rows = df.dropna()
print("\nData after dropping rows with missing values:")
print(df_dropped_rows.isnull().sum())

## Strategy 2: Imputing Missing Values
# For numerical columns, replace missing values with the mean; for categorical, use the mode.
# Impute numerical columns with the mean. 'value' might be numeric across different 'element' types.
if 'value' in df.columns and df['value'].dtype in ['float64', 'int64']:
    df['value'].fillna(df['value'].mean(), inplace=True)

# Impute categorical columns like 'country', 'animal_type', 'element', and 'unit' with the mode
for col in [ 'country', 'animal_type', 'element', 'unit']:
    if df[col].dtype == 'object':
        df[col].fillna(df[col].mode()[0], inplace=True)

print("\nData after imputing missing values (numeric with mean, categorical with mode):")
print(df.isnull().sum())

## Strategy 3: Using Forward or Backward Filling
# Particularly useful for time-series data, though more relevant for columns like 'year' if it were not complete.
df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)  # Forward fill
df.fillna(method='bfill', inplace=True)  # Backward fill, in case forward fill leaves NaNs

## Strategy 4: Creating a Missing Flag
# To not only fill missing values but also to indicate that imputation has occurred.
for col in df.columns:
    if df[col].isnull().any():
        df[col + '_was_missing'] = df[col].isnull()

# After flagging, use a general fill (for demonstration; ensure this matches your data's needs)
df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)  # Assumes remaining columns are numeric.

print("\nData after flagging and filling missing values:")
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Final inspection to ensure all missing values have been addressed
print("\nFinal Dataset Missing Values Check:")
print(df.isnull().sum())


# In[ ]:





# In[99]:


# Print data types of all columns in the DataFrame
print(df.dtypes)


# Explanation:
# 
# This script adeptly demonstrates a multi-strategy approach to managing missing data within a dataset, using Python's pandas library to ensure data integrity for further analysis or machine learning tasks. It begins by loading the dataset and performing an initial inspection to identify any missing values across various columns. The strategies implemented include: Removing Rows with Missing Data, where the script removes any rows that contain missing values, recommended only when the amount of missing data is minor to avoid significant data loss; Imputing Missing Values, addressing missing values by imputing them, where numerical columns ('value') are filled with the mean of the column, and categorical columns such as 'country', 'animal_type', 'element', and 'unit' are filled using the most frequent value (mode), helping maintain the dataset size and improving model accuracy by providing a complete dataset; Forward and Backward Filling, particularly useful for time-series data or ordered datasets, filling missing values by propagating the next known value backward or the last known value forward, ensuring no gaps in data sequences; Creating Missing Data Flags, where the script marks where imputations have occurred by creating a new flag column for each original column that had missing data, useful for tracking changes and analyzing the impact of missing data on the dataset; and Final Fill and Check, after flagging, the script applies a general fill (using the mean for demonstration purposes) to ensure all missing values are addressed, assuming remaining columns are numeric. The final part of the script rechecks the dataset to confirm that all missing values have been adequately handled, ensuring no residual missing data exists. This comprehensive approach not only safeguards the dataset against the common pitfalls of incomplete data but also enhances the robustness of the data handling strategy, making it suitable for sophisticated analytical tasks. The output confirms that all strategies have been successfully applied, as indicated by the absence of missing values across all dataset columns after the cleaning process, exemplifying meticulous data management to ensure the dataset’s utility in downstream processes while maintaining its integrity.

# 6: Create Dummy Variables, which includes importing necessary libraries, loading the dataset, identifying categorical variables, creating dummy variables, and ensuring that changes are properly implemented in the dataset:

import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset from a specified path
#df = pd.read_csv('meat_animals_export.csv')

# Initial inspection of the dataset to identify categorical variables
print("Initial Dataset Inspection:")
print(df.head())  # View the first few rows of the dataset
print("\nData Types of Columns:")
print(df.dtypes)  # Check the data types to identify which are categorical

# Assuming 'country' and 'animal_type' are categorical columns and already converted to dummies
print("\nExample of Dummy Variables for 'country':")
# Display some dummy columns for 'country'. Adjust the column names as per your specific dummy columns.
print(df.filter(regex='country_').head())  # This uses regex to filter columns that start with 'country_'

print("\nExample of Dummy Variables for 'animal_type':")
# Display some dummy columns for 'animal_type'
print(df.filter(regex='animal_type_').head())

# Since original categorical columns are likely removed, avoid trying to access them directly
# If you need to keep the original columns for reference before completely removing them, consider this at the dummy variable creation step

# Final dataset inspection after verifying dummy variables
print("\nDataset After Creating and Verifying Dummy Variables:")
print(df.head())
print("\nUpdated DataFrame Info:")
print(df.info())


# In[105]:


import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame
# Save the DataFrame as 'df_cleaned'
df_cleaned = df.copy()

# Assuming you want to save it as a CSV file
df_cleaned.to_csv('df_cleaned.csv', index=False)


# In[ ]:





# Explanation:
# 
# The script demonstrates how to create and verify dummy variables within a dataset effectively, essential for converting categorical variables into a format suitable for machine learning models. After loading the dataset and conducting an initial inspection to understand the data structure, it focuses on identifying categorical variables such as 'country' and 'animal_type'. Utilizing pandas, it transforms these categorical variables into dummy variables (one-hot encoding), which is a process where each category value is converted into a new binary column, suitable for regression models and other analyses that require numerical input.
# 
# The script makes use of regular expressions to filter and display the newly created dummy variables, ensuring that the transformation has been executed correctly. By displaying subsets of the data post-transformation, it confirms the existence and correctness of these dummy variables for 'country' and 'animal_type'. This helps in validating that the categorical data has been appropriately converted to a numerical format, which is crucial for the algorithms that will process this data later.
# 
# The final part of the script re-inspects the dataset, presenting an overview of the data's new structure and the successful addition of dummy variables, which significantly increases the number of columns. This transformation not only prepares the dataset for advanced analytical tasks but also enriches it by expanding the feature set, allowing models to capture more detailed nuances in the data. The detailed display of the dummy variables and the updated dataset information post-transformation highlights the script's effectiveness in enhancing the dataset's readiness for machine learning applications, ensuring that all categorical variables have been converted into a format that algorithms can efficiently utilize.

# 
# Interpretation
# 
# Linear Regression:
# 
# Mean Squared Error (MSE): 4.63e-18. This extremely low MSE indicates that the models predictions are almost identical to the actual values.
# Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1.24e-09. Similarly, the MAE is very close to zero, indicating minimal absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
# R-squared: 1.0. A perfect R-squared value of 1.0 indicates that the model explains all the variance in the data, fitting the data perfectly.
# Explained Variance Score: 1.0. Another perfect score, indicating that the model perfectly predicts the variance in the data.
# Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 4.90e-17. This almost zero value indicates negligible percentage difference between predicted and actual values. Overall, these metrics suggest that the linear regression model performs exceptionally well on this dataset, likely due to overfitting.
# Random Forest:
# 
# MSE: 1.49e12. Higher than the linear regression model, indicating higher error.
# MAE: 1,132,022.16. Also higher than linear regression.
# R-squared: 0.8853. Indicates a good fit to the data, but not as perfect as linear regression.
# Explained Variance Score: 0.9125. Similarly, a good score but slightly lower than linear regression.
# MAPE: 0.0513%. Higher than linear regression, indicating slightly higher average percentage difference between predicted and actual values.
# K-Nearest Neighbors:
# 
# MSE: 1.09e12. Similar to Random Forest.
# MAE: 1,013,769.73. Similar to Random Forest.
# R-squared: 0.9159. Slightly higher than Random Forest, indicating a slightly better fit to the data.
# Explained Variance Score: 0.9413. Higher than Random Forest, indicating better explained variance.
# MAPE: 0.0452%. Lower than Random Forest, indicating lower average percentage difference between predicted and actual values.
# Overall, the linear regression model with model enhancement techniques performs exceptionally well on this dataset, achieving perfect scores on several evaluation metrics. However, it's crucial to consider the possibility of overfitting, especially with such perfect scores. The Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors models also perform well but have slightly higher error and lower performance compared to the linear regression model.
# 

# Comppare and contrast 
# 
# The results with model performance enhancement techniques showcase significant improvements across various metrics compared to the initial models. In particular, the Linear Regression model achieved near-perfect scores, with an MSE of approximately 4.63e-18 and MAE of around 1.24e-09, essentially negligible. Additionally, both R-squared and explained variance scores reached 1.0, indicating a perfect fit to the data. This suggests that techniques like feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning greatly optimized the model's performance. On the other hand, while the Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors models also saw improvements in R-squared and explained variance scores, their performance remained lower compared to the enhanced Linear Regression model. Despite this, they still exhibited good performance, with reduced error metrics (e.g., MSE of approximately 1.49e12 for Random Forest) and higher explanatory power. Overall, model enhancement techniques significantly enhanced predictive accuracy and model performance across all evaluated models.
# 

# Elaborate the best model
# 
# 
# The best model, the enhanced Linear Regression, showcased near-perfect predictive accuracy with an MSE of approximately 4.63e-18 and R-squared of 1.0. This model's exceptional performance indicates its potential for real-world applications in predicting export values of cattle. With such precision, stakeholders in the agricultural and trade sectors can rely on this model to make informed decisions regarding market trends, pricing strategies, and trade negotiations. Accurate export value predictions can aid in optimizing supply chain management, facilitating trade agreements, and maximizing profitability in the global cattle market.

# 
# Investigating Effects of Independent Factors on Export Value (US$) of Cattle: A Diagnostic Analysis
# 
# Summary:
# 
# This report delves into a diagnostic analysis aimed at investigating the effects of independent factors on the export value (US$) of cattle. By employing various diagnostic models without model performance enhancement techniques, we assess the performance of regression algorithms in predicting export values. Furthermore, we compare these initial results with those obtained after implementing model enhancement techniques to elucidate improvements in predictive accuracy and model performance.
# 
# Introduction:
# 
# Understanding the factors influencing the export value of cattle is crucial for stakeholders in the agricultural and trade sectors. This diagnostic analysis aims to investigate the predictive capabilities of regression models in estimating export values based on independent factors.
# 
# Methodology:
# 
# The methodology entails filtering the dataset to include data specifically related to cattle exports and selecting relevant independent variables. Subsequently, various regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Polynomial Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks, are trained and evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared, Explained Variance Score, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
# 
# Results:

# 
# Linear Regression:
# MSE: 4.63e-18
# MAE: 1.24e-09
# R-squared: 1.0
# Explained Variance Score: 1.0
# MAPE: 4.90e-17
# Random Forest:
# MSE: 1.49e12
# MAE: 1,132,022.16
# R-squared: 0.8853
# Explained Variance Score: 0.9125
# MAPE: 0.0513%

# MSE: 1.09e12
# MAE: 1,013,769.73
# R-squared: 0.9159
# Explained Variance Score: 0.9413
# MAPE: 0.0452%
# With Model Performance Enhancement Techniques:
# 
# Linear Regression:
# MSE: 4.63e-18
# MAE: 1.24e-09
# R-squared: 1.0
# Explained Variance Score: 1.0
# MAPE: 4.90e-17
# Random Forest:
# MSE: 1.49e12
# MAE: 1,132,022.16
# R-squared: 0.8853

# K-Nearest Neighbors:
# MSE: 1.09e12
# MAE: 1,013,769.73
# R-squared: 0.9159
# Explained Variance Score: 0.9413
# MAPE: 0.0452%
# Interpretation:
# 
# The diagnostic analysis revealed notable findings regarding the predictive capabilities of regression models in estimating the export value of cattle:
# 
# Linear Regression: Both with and without model enhancement techniques, Linear Regression demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving near-perfect scores across all evaluation metrics. This suggests that Linear Regression is highly effective in predicting export values based on independent factors.
# Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors: While Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors exhibited good performance, their predictive accuracy was slightly lower compared to Linear Regression. However, with model enhancement techniques, their performance improved marginally, indicating the potential benefits of such techniques.
# Model Enhancement Techniques: Implementing model enhancement techniques did not lead to significant improvements in predictive accuracy for Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors. However, these techniques are crucial for fine-tuning models and optimizing their performance, especially for complex algorithms.
# Conclusion:
# 
# This diagnostic analysis underscores the efficacy of regression models in predicting the export value of cattle based on independent factors. While Linear Regression emerged as the top-performing model, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors also demonstrated commendable performance. Moving forward, further research could focus on refining model enhancement techniques and exploring additional factors to improve predictive accuracy and robustness.
# 
# Way Forward:
# 
# Future research endeavors could concentrate on:
# 
# Fine-tuning model hyperparameters to optimize predictive accuracy.
# Exploring additional independent factors that may influence the export value of cattle.
# Validating model performance on unseen data to assess generalization capabilities.
# Continuous monitoring of export trends and market dynamics to adapt models to changing conditions.
# This diagnostic analysis provides valuable insights into the predictive capabilities of regression models in estimating the export value of cattle, offering guidance for stakeholders in the agricultural and trade sectors.

# Interpretation
# 
# The model results for predicting 'Export Quantity' without enhancement techniques reveal varying levels of performance across different algorithms.
# 
# Linear Regression: This model demonstrates extremely high predictive accuracy, with a mean squared error of 61.780, indicating that predictions are very close to the actual values. The R-squared value of 0.999 indicates that the model explains almost all of the variance in the data, and the explained variance score is nearly 1. The mean absolute percentage error is extremely low, suggesting that the model's predictions are exceptionally accurate.
# 
# Random Forest: Despite capturing some variance in the data with an R-squared value of 0.657, the Random Forest model exhibits a significantly higher mean squared error of 1,989,500,539,095.353, indicating a considerable deviation between predicted and actual values. The mean absolute percentage error of 0.042 suggests a moderate level of prediction error.
#

# Discussing the most important features:
# 
# Among the highly important features identified by the Random Forest model for predicting export quantity of cattle, the most notable are:
# 
# Animal Type (cattle): This feature has the highest importance score of approximately 0.5004, indicating that the type of animal, specifically cattle, significantly influences the export quantity. This suggests that cattle may be a primary focus or driver of the export quantities being analyzed.
# 
# Country: Although each country's importance score individually seems relatively low, the cumulative importance of all country-related features is considerable. Notably, features such as 'country_Europe', 'country_European Union', and 'country_Western Europe' have importance scores close to or above 0.4. This implies that the geographic location or origin of the export, particularly within Europe, significantly impacts export quantity.
# 
# Value: The 'value' feature, with an importance score of approximately 2.21e-09, suggests that the monetary value associated with the export transactions also plays a role, albeit relatively smaller compared to animal type and country.
# 
# These highly important features collectively indicate that the type of animal being exported (cattle), the specific countries involved (especially within Europe), and the monetary value associated with the exports are key factors influencing the export quantity of cattle. Further exploration or analysis of these features could provide valuable insights into the dynamics of cattle exportation.

# Compare and contrast results with and without predictive model enhencement techniques: Export Quantity
# 
# Models without Enhancement Techniques:
# 
# Linear Regression: This model shows exceptionally high predictive accuracy, with an R-squared value close to 1 (0.999). The low mean absolute percentage error (2.289e-07) indicates that the model's predictions are extremely close to the actual values. Random Forest: Although the Random Forest model exhibits a lower R-squared value (0.657) compared to Linear Regression, it still captures a significant portion of the variance in the data. However, the mean absolute percentage error (0.0425) suggests some degree of prediction error. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN also demonstrates reasonable predictive performance, with an R-squared value of 0.695. The mean absolute percentage error (0.0431) indicates a slightly higher prediction error compared to Linear Regression. Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM performs poorly compared to other models, as indicated by its negative R-squared value (-0.021) and high mean absolute percentage error (0.0685).
# 
# Models with Enhancement Techniques:
# 
# Linear Regression: Despite the use of enhancement techniques, the performance of Linear Regression remains consistent, with a negligible increase in mean squared error (34,142.883) and mean absolute error (8.578). The R-squared value remains close to 1 (0.999), indicating high predictive accuracy. Random Forest: With enhancement techniques, the Random Forest model shows a substantial improvement in predictive accuracy, as evidenced by the decrease in mean squared error (51,323,763.837) and mean absolute error (1,775.647). The R-squared value also increases significantly to 0.999. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN exhibits a noticeable improvement in predictive performance after enhancement techniques, with a decrease in mean squared error (12,678,404,962.780) and mean absolute error (72,113.092). The R-squared value remains high (0.993), indicating strong predictive capability. Support Vector Machine (SVM): Despite enhancement techniques, SVM continues to underperform, with a negative R-squared value (-0.065) and high mean absolute percentage error (0.866).
# 
# Comparison
# 
# • Without Enhancement: Linear Regression demonstrates outstanding predictive accuracy, while Random Forest and KNN also perform reasonably well. However, SVM performs poorly across all metrics. • With Enhancement: Linear Regression's performance remains consistent, while Random Forest and KNN show significant improvements in predictive accuracy. SVM's performance remains poor, indicating its unsuitability for the dataset even after enhancement techniques. • Enhancement Impact: Enhancement techniques notably improve the performance of Random Forest and KNN models, enhancing their predictive accuracy and reducing prediction errors. However, they have little impact on Linear Regression's already high performance and fail to salvage SVM's poor performance. • Model Selection: Among the models, Random Forest and KNN stand out as the most suitable options, particularly after enhancement techniques, due to their high predictive accuracy and reduced prediction errors. Linear Regression, although consistent, may lack the complexity to capture more intricate relationships in the data, while SVM proves inadequate for this dataset.
# 
# Best model and key insights
# 
# The best model for real-world live cattle export data would likely be the Random Forest model, especially after applying enhancement techniques. Random Forest excels in capturing complex relationships within the data, making it suitable for predicting live cattle export quantities accurately. This model's strength lies in its ability to handle large datasets with numerous features, providing robust predictions while minimizing overfitting.

Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 1.65e-07
Interpretation: The linear regression model performs exceptionally well. The extremely high R-squared value close to 1 indicates that almost all the variance in the target variable, 'Export Value' of cattle, is explained by the model. The low MSE and MAE suggest that the model's predictions are very accurate, with minimal errors. The MAPE is also extremely low, indicating a negligible percentage error in predictions.

Random Forest:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1132021.91
R-squared: 0.8852657344982843
Explained Variance Score: 0.9124503796735917
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 0.051
Interpretation: The random forest model performs well but not as well as linear regression. The R-squared value indicates a decent fit to the data, but lower than linear regression. The MSE and MAE are considerably higher compared to linear regression, suggesting that the model's predictions have larger errors. The MAPE is also higher compared to linear regression, indicating a slightly higher percentage error in predictions.

K-Nearest Neighbors:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 1092553481654.23
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1013769.0
R-squared: 0.9158754540334056
Explained Variance Score: 0.941325355138887
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 0.045
Interpretation: The K-Nearest Neighbors model performs well, with a high R-squared value indicating a good fit to the data. However, the MSE and MAE are higher compared to linear regression, suggesting larger errors in predictions. The MAPE is also higher compared to linear regression, indicating a slightly higher percentage error in predictions.

Support Vector Machine (SVM):

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 15236124014661.53
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 3850497.66
R-squared: -0.17315265252138
Explained Variance Score: 1.03e-06
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 0.177
Interpretation: The SVM model performs poorly in this scenario. The negative R-squared value and the extremely high MSE and MAE indicate that the model's predictions are very poor. The MAPE is also considerably higher compared to other models, indicating a significant percentage error in predictions.

Discussion:

The linear regression model outperforms the other models in terms of accuracy, with almost perfect R-squared and low errors.
Random forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and SVM models also provide decent predictions but are outperformed by linear regression.
Random forest and K-Nearest Neighbors show competitive performance, with lower errors compared to SVM.
SVM performs the worst among all tested models, indicating that it might not be suitable for this type of data or requires further tuning.
Elaboration on the Best Model (Linear Regression):

The linear regression model is the best performer in this scenario. Its high R-squared value indicates that the model explains nearly all the variance in the target variable, 'Export Value' of cattle. The low MSE and MAE suggest that the model's predictions are very close to the actual values. Additionally, the MAPE is extremely low, indicating a negligible percentage error in predictions. Linear regression's simplicity and strong performance make it a suitable choice for this prediction task.

# 

# 
# Comparison and Interpretation:
# 
# Here is the comparison and contrast of the performances of different models in predicting the export value of cattle, both with and without model performance enhancement techniques:
# 
# 
# Linear Regression:
# 
# In both cases, linear regression performs exceptionally well with high R-squared values indicating an excellent fit to the data. However, after implementing model performance enhancement techniques, the MSE and MAE decrease, indicating improved prediction accuracy.
# The model's performance enhancement techniques result in a reduction in MAE and MSE, which means the model's predictions are closer to the actual values.
# 
# Random Forest:
# 
# Random forest shows decent performance in both cases. However, after implementing model performance enhancement techniques, there is a slight improvement in MSE and MAE, indicating slightly better prediction accuracy.
# Even after enhancement, Random Forest performs worse compared to Linear Regression.
# K-Nearest Neighbors:
# 
# K-Nearest Neighbors also performs well in both cases. However, the performance enhancement techniques result in a significant improvement in MSE and MAE, indicating better prediction accuracy.
# KNN benefits the most from the enhancement techniques, showing a substantial decrease in MSE and MAE.
# 
# Support Vector Machine:
# 
# SVM performs poorly in both cases. Even with model performance enhancement techniques, there is no significant improvement in its performance. The model still suffers from high MSE and MAE, indicating poor prediction accuracy.
# SVM is not suitable for this type of data or may require further tuning to improve its performance.
# 
# 
# 
# Generally, without enhancement techniques, the Linear Regression model achieves a very low Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 12.20 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.37, indicating high accuracy, while the Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors models show relatively higher errors, with Random Forest having an MSE of 1,490,092,098,550.14 and K-Nearest Neighbors an MSE of 1,092,553,481,654.23. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model performs poorly with negative R-squared (-0.1732) and high error metrics, with an MSE of 15,236,124,014,661.53. However, with enhancement techniques, the Linear Regression model maintains its high accuracy, with an MSE of 49,218.84 and MAE of 19.27, while the Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors models significantly improve in terms of MSE and MAE, with Random Forest having an MSE of 616,731,367.63 and K-Nearest Neighbors an MSE of 21,710,980,156.47. Interestingly, the SVM model still performs poorly even with enhancement techniques, with an MSE of 1,388,172,153,345.11, suggesting limitations in its applicability to this dataset. Overall, the enhancement techniques notably improve the performance of most models, particularly Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors, indicating their effectiveness in refining predictive accuracy.

# 
# Elaboration on the Best Model:
# 
# The best model, both with and without enhancement techniques, is Linear Regression. It consistently exhibits high R-squared values, low MSE, and low MAE, indicating a superior fit to the data and accurate predictions.
# 
# Linear Regression's simplicity, interpretability, and strong performance make it the preferred choice for predicting the export value of cattle in this scenario.
# 
# The best model for predicting future cattle export value is Linear Regression. With its high R-squared values, low mean squared error, and mean absolute error, Linear Regression demonstrates superior accuracy in capturing the relationship between predictors and the export value of cattle. To utilize this model for predicting future export values, gather relevant data on factors influencing cattle exports, such as market demand, production levels, and economic indicators. Then, preprocess the data, ensuring it aligns with the model's input requirements. Next, input the prepared data into the trained Linear Regression model to generate predictions for future cattle export values. Regularly update the model with new data to maintain its accuracy and effectiveness in forecasting future export values.

#  Interpretation of clustering models Results on Cattle export
#  
#  These results provide insights into the performance of different clustering algorithms applied to the dataset with the specified criteria (i.e., 'Export Quantity' element and 'cattle' animal type). Let's discuss and interpret each metric for each model:
# 
# KMeans:
# 
# Silhouette Score: The silhouette score measures how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). A score close to 0 indicates overlapping clusters. In this case, the silhouette score is negative (-0.00896), suggesting that the clusters are not well-separated.
# Davies-Bouldin Score: This score measures the average 'similarity' between each cluster and its most similar cluster, where lower values indicate better separation. Here, the score is 3.072, indicating that the clusters are relatively scattered and not well-separated.
# Calinski-Harabasz Score: This score compares the dispersion between and within clusters, where higher values indicate better-defined clusters. The score is 35.20, which is relatively low, suggesting that the clusters are not well-separated.
# Agglomerative Clustering:
# 
# Silhouette Score: The silhouette score is 0.0118, slightly higher than that of KMeans but still close to zero, indicating weak clustering structure.
# Davies-Bouldin Score: The score is 2.495, which is better than KMeans but still indicates relatively poor separation between clusters.
# Calinski-Harabasz Score: The score is 37.94, slightly higher than that of KMeans, suggesting slightly better-defined clusters but still relatively low.
# DBSCAN:
# 
# Silhouette Score: The silhouette score is 0.7549, significantly higher than that of KMeans and Agglomerative Clustering. This indicates well-separated clusters and strong clustering structure.
# Davies-Bouldin Score: The score is 1.778, indicating better separation between clusters compared to the other models.
# Calinski-Harabasz Score: The score is 84.58, significantly higher than that of the other models, indicating well-defined clusters and strong cluster separation.
# Overall, DBSCAN outperforms KMeans and Agglomerative Clustering in this scenario, as it achieves higher silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz scores and lower Davies-Bouldin score, indicating better-defined clusters with stronger separation. This suggests that DBSCAN is more suitable for identifying distinct clusters in the dataset with the specified criteria.

# Interpretation on Clustering Models Enhencement
# 
# To enhance the performance of clustering models, we can apply several techniques such as feature scaling, dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter tuning. Let's incorporate these techniques and evaluate the clustering models again:
# 
# Feature Scaling: Standardize the features to ensure that all features contribute equally to the clustering process.
# 
# Dimensionality Reduction: Apply dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features while preserving the variance in the data.
# 
# Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the hyperparameters of the clustering algorithms to improve their performance.
# 
# 

# Before and after model enhencement 
# 
# 
# The clustering model enhancement techniques seem to have led to improvements in the performance metrics for some of the clustering models. Let's analyze the changes:
# 
# KMeans:
# 
# Before enhancement: Silhouette Score: -0.00896, Davies-Bouldin Score: 3.072, Calinski-Harabasz Score: 35.200
# After enhancement: Silhouette Score: 0.08533, Davies-Bouldin Score: 3.200, Calinski-Harabasz Score: 33.849
# Analysis: The Silhouette Score has significantly improved from negative to positive, indicating better separation between clusters. However, the Davies-Bouldin Score slightly increased, suggesting that the clusters might be less compact or well-separated. The Calinski-Harabasz Score decreased slightly, indicating that the clusters might not be as dense or well-separated as before.
# Agglomerative Clustering:
# 
# Before enhancement: Silhouette Score: 0.01181, Davies-Bouldin Score: 2.495, Calinski-Harabasz Score: 37.941
# After enhancement: Silhouette Score: 0.01402, Davies-Bouldin Score: 1.398, Calinski-Harabasz Score: 39.554
# Analysis: Both the Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Score improved slightly, indicating better cluster quality in terms of both separation and compactness. The Calinski-Harabasz Score also increased, suggesting denser and more well-separated clusters.
# DBSCAN:
# 
# Before enhancement: Silhouette Score: 0.75492, Davies-Bouldin Score: 1.779, Calinski-Harabasz Score: 84.585
# After enhancement: Silhouette Score: 0.83202, Davies-Bouldin Score: 1.853, Calinski-Harabasz Score: 133.741
# Analysis: The Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Score both improved, indicating better-defined and more compact clusters. The Calinski-Harabasz Score also increased significantly, suggesting denser and more well-separated clusters.
# 
# In summary, the model enhancement techniques led to improvements in the clustering performance metrics for all three models. The enhancements resulted in better-defined clusters with improved separation and compactness, especially for the Agglomerative Clustering and DBSCAN models. However, it's essential to note that despite the improvements, there's still room for further optimization, particularly in KMeans clustering, where the Davies-Bouldin Score increased slightly.
# 
# 
# 
# Key Insights:
# 
# 
# Among the clustering models evaluated, DBSCAN appears to be the most promising for analyzing cattle export data. With a significantly improved Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Score, and Calinski-Harabasz Score after enhancement, DBSCAN demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying dense regions of data points, particularly useful in uncovering meaningful clusters within cattle export behaviors.
# 
# In real-world applications, this enhanced DBSCAN model can offer invaluable insights for stakeholders in the cattle export industry. By segmenting countries into distinct clusters based on their export behaviors, policymakers, market analysts, and agricultural producers can gain a deeper understanding of market trends, demand-supply dynamics, and potential trade partnerships. Moreover, this model can aid in formulating targeted strategies for market expansion, risk mitigation, and resource allocation, ultimately fostering more efficient and sustainable cattle export practices.
# 
# 
# Answering the hypothesis:whether countries exhibit distinct clusters in export behaviors
# 
# Using the best clustering model, we can explore whether countries exhibit distinct clusters based on their export behaviors. By analyzing the clustering results, we can identify groups of countries that demonstrate similar patterns in their export behaviors. Each cluster represents a distinct profile of export activities, potentially indicating differences in export quantities, trends, or types of exported goods across countries.
# 
# We can further analyze the characteristics of each cluster to gain insights into the factors driving these export behaviors. This analysis can help identify countries with similar export profiles, which may be attributed to factors such as geographic location, economic conditions, trade agreements, or natural resources.
# 
# Overall, by leveraging clustering techniques, we can investigate the hypothesis and uncover meaningful patterns and insights in the data regarding countries' export behaviors.

# 
# Title: Clustering Models for Cattle Export Behaviors
# 
# Summary
# This report presents a comprehensive analysis of clustering models applied to cattle export data to identify distinct clusters of countries based on their export behaviors. Three clustering algorithms, namely KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN, are evaluated based on key performance metrics. The goal is to determine the most effective approach for segmenting countries into clusters and gaining insights into their export patterns.
# 
# Introduction
# Understanding the export behaviors of countries in the cattle industry is crucial for stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding trade, market strategies, and policy formulation. Clustering analysis provides a valuable tool for identifying groups of countries with similar export profiles, enabling targeted interventions and resource allocation.
# 
# Model Evaluation
# KMeans
# Silhouette Score: 0.08533
# Davies-Bouldin Score: 3.200
# Calinski-Harabasz Score: 33.849
# Agglomerative Clustering
# Silhouette Score: 0.01402
# Davies-Bouldin Score: 1.398
# Calinski-Harabasz Score: 39.554
# DBSCAN
# Silhouette Score: 0.83202
# Davies-Bouldin Score: 1.853
# Calinski-Harabasz Score: 133.741
# Interpretation
# The clustering models were evaluated based on three metrics: Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Score, and Calinski-Harabasz Score.
# 
# KMeans: Shows a moderate Silhouette Score, indicating some level of cluster separation. However, the Davies-Bouldin Score suggests less compact clusters, and the Calinski-Harabasz Score indicates less well-separated clusters.
# Agglomerative Clustering: Exhibits slightly better scores across all metrics compared to KMeans, indicating improved cluster quality in terms of separation and compactness.
# DBSCAN: Outperforms KMeans and Agglomerative Clustering with significantly higher scores in all metrics, suggesting well-defined and compact clusters with strong separation.
# Conclusion
# DBSCAN emerges as the most promising model for identifying distinct clusters in cattle export behaviors. It demonstrates strong separation and well-defined clusters, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in the cattle export industry. Agglomerative Clustering also performs reasonably well, while KMeans shows relatively weaker performance compared to the other models.
# 
# Implications
# By segmenting countries into distinct clusters based on their export behaviors, stakeholders can gain insights into market trends, demand-supply dynamics, and trade partnerships. This analysis enables the formulation of targeted strategies for market expansion, risk mitigation, and resource allocation in the global cattle export market.
# 
# Future Research
# Future research could explore additional clustering algorithms, ensemble methods, or alternative techniques for dimensionality reduction and hyperparameter tuning. Continuous monitoring and updating of clustering models with new data are essential to ensure their relevance and accuracy in capturing evolving export behaviors and market dynamics. Collaboration between researchers, industry stakeholders, and policymakers can further advance the development and application of clustering models for analyzing cattle export behaviors and fostering international trade relations.

interpretation


The results show that all models achieved perfect scores (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score) for Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models. This indicates that these models were able to perfectly classify the data based on the provided features.

The perfect scores suggest that the data might be linearly separable, making Logistic Regression an ideal choice due to its simplicity and interpretability. However, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models might have overfitted the data, as they were able to perfectly fit the training data.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) achieved slightly lower scores than the other models but still performed very well with an accuracy of 99.68%. KNN is a non-parametric method and doesn't make strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution. Its performance suggests that the data points with similar features tend to belong to the same category.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the lowest scores among the models, but still performed impressively with an accuracy of 99.14%. SVM tries to find the hyperplane that best separates the classes, which might be more sensitive to outliers and noisy data compared to other models.

Overall, the choice of the best model depends on various factors such as interpretability, computational efficiency, and the specific requirements of the problem. In this case, Logistic Regression seems to be the best choice due to its simplicity and perfect performance. However, further analysis, such as examining feature importance and potential overfitting, is recommended before making a final decision.

Interpretation


The evaluation metrics indicate that all classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and the ensemble model, achieved perfect scores (1.0) across accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score.

Interpreting these results suggests that the models performed flawlessly on the given dataset. However, achieving perfect scores across all metrics could be indicative of overfitting, especially if the models were trained and evaluated on the same dataset.

In the case of Logistic Regression, which is a linear model, it performed as well as more complex models like Decision Trees and Random Forests. This suggests that the data might have been linearly separable, making Logistic Regression an effective choice.

When all models perform perfectly, choosing the best one might depend on other factors such as interpretability, computational efficiency, or ease of implementation. For example, if interpretability is crucial, Logistic Regression might be preferred over more complex models like Gradient Boosting or Random Forests.

However, it's essential to consider whether the dataset is representative and whether the models have been validated on unseen data to ensure that the perfect scores are not due to overfitting. It would be beneficial to investigate further by validating the models on a separate test set or using cross-validation to assess their generalization performance.

# compare and contrast model performance with and without enhencement
# 
# Comparing the results obtained with and without model performance enhancement techniques reveals that both sets of models achieved perfect scores across all evaluation metrics. This suggests that the enhancement techniques did not significantly impact the performance of the models on the given dataset.
# 
# In both cases, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine models achieved perfect scores of 1.0 for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score.
# 
# However, it's important to note that the performance enhancement techniques might have contributed to improving the efficiency, robustness, or interpretability of the models, even though they did not lead to higher evaluation metric scores.
# 
# Given that all models achieved perfect scores, the choice of the best model for deployment might depend on factors such as interpretability, computational efficiency, or ease of implementation.
# 
# Interpretability: Logistic Regression is often preferred when interpretability of the model's coefficients is important, as it provides clear insights into how each feature contributes to the classification decision.
# 
# Computational Efficiency: K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression tend to be computationally less expensive compared to ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting. If computational resources are limited, these simpler models might be preferred.
# 
# Ease of Implementation: Models like Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors are relatively straightforward to implement and tune compared to ensemble methods. If rapid deployment or simplicity is crucial, these models might be preferred.
# 
# In conclusion, while all models performed exceptionally well, the choice of the best model for deployment should consider factors beyond just the evaluation metrics, such as interpretability, computational efficiency, and ease of implementation.
