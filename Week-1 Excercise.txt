Submission Instructions
Click the title above to submit your assignment.
This exercise is due by Sunday 11:59 PM.
Submit your code, output, and answers at the link above. Comment all your code and answer any questions that are asked in the instructions. It is perfectly fine to answer a question by displaying output from your code, but make sure you are displaying the appropriate output to answer the question. I would recommend using and submitting a Jupyter Notebook, but this is not required.
